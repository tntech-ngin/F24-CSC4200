Use packet capture to visually inspect protocols.
Overview
In this warmup project, you are going to implement a client and a server program that will send a command over the network. The command simply turns on an LED light. However, the LED light speaks a special protocol. All we know about this protocol is the packet format used for turning on the light. Your task is to create this packet and then send it to the server for turning on this light. Server Specifications
The server takes two arguments:
\$ lightserver -p \u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt; -l \u0026lt;LOG FILE LOCATION\u0026gt; 1.PORT - The port server listens on.
2.Log file location - Where you will keep a record of actions.
For example: \$ lightserver -p 30000 -l /tmp/logfile Deliverables (each worth 5 points)
Server must parse two command line arguments, port and log locations.
The server must not exit after receiving a single packet.
Once a client connects, it logs a message in the following format \u0026quot;Received connection from \u0026lt;CLIENT IP, PORT\u0026gt; \u0026quot;
Once it receives a hello message from the client, it logs the connection and sends a hello back to the client.
You can assume the packet format is the following:
+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | | | | |Version(4 bytes) |Message type (4 bytes) |Message Length (4 bytes) | | | | | | | | | +-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | Message (Max 8 Bytes) | | | | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ It receives the packet header first, followed by the message. Hint: You need two RECV calls.
Check if Version == 17. If not, log an error message VERSION MISMATCH and continue to listen. Do not exit.
If Version == 17, check the message type. If message Type is 1 - the corresponding command is LIGHTON. If message type is 2 - the corresponding command is LIGHTOFF. No other command is supported.
If the server sees a supported command, log \u0026ldquo;EXECUTING SUPPORTED COMMAND: COMMANDNAME\u0026rdquo;, else log \u0026lt;\u0026ldquo;IGNORING UNKNOWN COMMAND: COMMANDNAME\u0026rdquo;.
Send back a \u0026ldquo;SUCCESS\u0026rdquo; message to the client.
It turns on or turns off the LED on your circuit based on the command sent by the client.
Make sure server does not exit on 0 byte messages. Client Specifications
\$ lightclient -s \u0026lt;SERVER-IP\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt; -l LOGFILE The client takes three arguments:
Server IP - The IP address of the server. PORT - The port the server listens on. Log file location - Where you will keep a record of packets you received. For example: \$ lightclient -s 192.168.2.1 -p 6543 -l LOGFILE Client Requirements (each worth 5 points, item 7 is worth 10 points)
The client must parse three command line arguments, server, port, and logfile. The client should connect to the server on the specified port. Constructs and sends a hello packet to the server. +-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | | | | |Version(4 bytes) |Message type (4 bytes) |Message Length (4 bytes) | | | | | | | | | +-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | Message (HELLO) | | | | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Receive reply from Server - if version is 17, log \u0026ldquo;VERSION ACCEPTED\u0026rdquo;, else log - \u0026ldquo;VERSION MISMATCH\u0026rdquo; If version is accepted, send a command packet. +-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | | | | |Version(4 bytes) |Message type (4 bytes) |Message Length (4 bytes) | | | | | | | | | +-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+ | | | | | COMMAND (LIGHTON/LIGHTOFF) | | | | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Receive the server\u0026rsquo;s reply, log the reply, and gracefully shutdown the socket. You can assume the server always replies with a \u0026ldquo;SUCCESS\u0026rdquo; message for this assignment. Use TCPDUMP or Wireshark to capture the interactions, turn the .pcap file in with the assignment. Additional requirements:
Code must compile/run on your VM. You will demo this to the TA.
You must pack the packet in a structure. If you are using python, use the struct module.
Pay extra attention to byte-order encoding before sending the packet. Big-endianness is the dominant ordering in today\u0026rsquo;s network protocols.

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a client-server system using Raspberry Pi devices. The server will control an LED, while the client will sense motion using a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) and communicate with the server to blink the LED. The assignment includes establishing a three-way handshake, sending blink duration and count information, acknowledging the data, and responding to motion detection by blinking the LED. The client and server communications MUST use UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) and NOT TCP.
The objectives are:
\u0026ndash; Learn about physical computing
\u0026ndash; Learn about protocol development
Server Specifications
The server (we name it lightserver) takes two arguments:
\$ lightserver -p \u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt; -s \u0026lt;LOG FILE LOCATION\u0026gt; 1.PORT - The port server listens on.
2.Log File Location - log file location
Server\u0026rsquo;s Functional requirements
The server must open a UDP socket on the specified port number The server should gracefully process incorrect port number and exit with a non-zero error code The server runs indefinitely - it does not exit. The server accepts connections from multiple clients (bonus points) server works with any client developed by other teams (bonus points) Client Specifications
The client (we name it lightclient) takes three arguments: \$ lightclient -s \u0026lt;SERVER-IP\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;PORT\u0026gt; -l LOGFILE The client takes three arguments:
1.Server IP - The IP address of the lightserver.
2.PORT - The port the server listens on.
2.Log file location - Where you will keep a record of packets you received.
For example: \$ lightclient -s 192.168.2.1 -p 6543 -l LOGFILE Packet Specification
The payload of each UDP packet sent by server and client MUST start with the following 12-byte header. All fields are in network order (most significant bit first):
0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Sequence Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Acknowledgment Number | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Not Used |A|S|F| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |	| |	Payload	| |	| +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Where:
Sequence Number (32 bits): If SYN is present (the S flag is set) the sequence number is the initial sequence number (randomly choosen).
Acknowledgement Number (32 bits): If the ACK bit is set, this field contains the value of the next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to receive. Once a connection is established this is always sent.
The acknowledgement number is given in the unit of bytes (how many bytes you have sent)
Not Used (29 bits): Must be zero.
A (ACK, 1 bit): Indicates that there the value of Acknowledgment Number field is valid
S (SYN, 1 bit): Synchronize sequence numbers
F (FIN, 1 bit): Finish, No more data from sender
This is the protocol you will implement
The client opens a UDP socket and initiate 3-way handshake to the specified hostname/ip and port. Essentially, the client and server will exchange three packets with the following flags set: (1) SYN (2) SYN|ACK (3)ACK. At the end of the handshake, they will have learned each other\u0026rsquo;s sequence number.
The client then sends the duration and number of blinks as a payload.
The server acknowledges the duration and the number of blinks by sending back the duration and number of blinks. It then waits for the client to sense motion.
The client senses motion using the PIR. See here for details on how to connect the PIR to the PI. [Connecting PIR to PI]{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/11}
When motion is detected, the client logs it, and sends a message with the following string as the payload :MotionDetected
The server parses it, logs :MotionDetected to its log, and drives (blinks) the LED for the pre-determined amount of times.
Client sends a packet with the FIN bit set. The server logs \u0026ldquo;:Interaction with completed. This finishes the interaction.
Timestamp format is \u0026ldquo;YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS\u0026rdquo;.
Hardware Components #Raspberry Pi Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) LED Resistor Jumper wires Breadboard Server Setup #The server Raspberry Pi should be programmed to drive the LED. It should be capable of receiving data from the client and blinking the LED accordingly. Client Setup #The client Raspberry Pi should be programmed to interface with the PIR sensor. It should be able to establish a connection with the server. The client should continuously sense motion using the PIR sensor. You may test both server and client on the same board.
